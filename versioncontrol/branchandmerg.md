# Trunk-Based Development
Trunk-Based Development is based on the following principles:

1. Mainline Branch: Our team maintains a single mainline branch ("main") as the central source of truth for the project.

2. Continuous Integration: Developers integrate their changes into the mainline branch multiple times throughout the day.

3. Short-Lived Feature Branches: Feature branches are created for developing new features or addressing specific issues. These branches have a short lifespan and are merged back into the mainline branch as soon as they are ready.

4. Minimal Long-Lived Branches: Long-lived branches are discouraged to prevent divergence and minimize integration difficulties.

# Git Usage in Our Team:
Our team utilizes Git as the version control system to support Trunk-Based Development. Here's an overview of how we use Git:

1. Mainline Branch:
The master branch serves as our mainline branch.
It always represents the latest stable version of the codebase.

2. Feature Development:
For new feature development or bug fixes, developers create feature branches based on the master branch.
Feature branches have clear names and follow a consistent naming convention.
Developers work on their feature branches, making regular commits as they progress.

3. Continuous Integration:
Developers frequently integrate their changes into the mainline branch by merging or rebasing their feature branches onto the latest master.
Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines are set up to automatically build, test, and validate the code changes before merging them into the mainline branch.

4. Code Review:
Pull Requests (PRs) or Code Review processes are followed to ensure quality and maintain code standards.
Before merging a feature branch into the mainline, it must receive approval from at least one reviewer.

5. Merging to Mainline:
Once a feature branch is reviewed and approved, it is merged into the mainline branch.
Merge commits are used to preserve the history and provide traceability.

6. Release Process:
We follow a release branching strategy for preparing stable releases.
Release branches are created from the master branch, and specific release-related tasks are performed on these branches.
Once a release branch is ready, it is merged back into the master branch, and a new release is tagged.

7. Conflict Resolution:
In case of conflicts during merging, developers work collaboratively to resolve them.
Regular communication and collaboration are encouraged to minimize conflicts and keep the mainline branch stable.
##### Conclusion:
Trunk-Based Development, supported by Git, enables our team to achieve frequent integration, maintain a stable mainline branch, and deliver features more efficiently. By utilizing short-lived feature branches, continuous integration, and collaborative code review, we enhance code quality, reduce integration risks, and streamline our development process.
