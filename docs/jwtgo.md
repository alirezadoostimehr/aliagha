# JWT-go

## Initialization
To install the github.com/golang-jwt/jwt package, follow these steps:

    Open your terminal or command prompt.
    Run the following command:

   go get github.com/golang-jwt/jwt

This command will download and install the package and its dependencies.

## Usage
The github.com/golang-jwt/jwt package provides functionality for working with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. Here's how you can use the package in your application:

    Import the package in your Go file:

   import "github.com/golang-jwt/jwt"

    Use the package's functions, types, and constants to work with JWTs.
    Here's an example of how to create a new JWT token, set some claims, and generate the token string using a secret key:


   package main

   import (
       "fmt"
       "github.com/golang-jwt/jwt"
       "time"
   )

   func main() {
       // Create a new token
       token := jwt.New(jwt.SigningMethodHS256)

       // Set claims
       claims := token.Claims.(jwt.MapClaims)
       claims["username"] = "john.doe"
       claims["exp"] = jwt.TimeFunc().Add(time.Hour * 24).Unix()

       // Generate the token string
       tokenString, err := token.SignedString([]byte("secret-key"))
       if err != nil {
           fmt.Println("Error generating token:", err)
           return
       }

       fmt.Println("Token:", tokenString)
   }

In the above example, we create a new JWT token, set some claims (including an expiration time), and generate the token string using a secret key. Make sure to replace "secret-key" with your own secret key in a real application.
## Features
The github.com/golang-jwt/jwt package offers the following features:

    JWT Creation and Signing:
        Generate new JWTs with custom claims using the jwt.NewWithClaims function.
        Sign JWTs with a secret key using the jwt.SigningMethodHS256 method.
    JWT Parsing and Verification:
        Parse and validate JWTs using the jwt.Parse or jwt.ParseWithClaims functions.
        Verify the JWT's signature, expiration, and other claims.
    Custom Claims and Metadata:
        Create custom claim types by implementing the jwt.Claims interface.
        Add custom claims to a JWT during creation.
    Supported Signing Algorithms:
        HMAC algorithms: HMAC-SHA256.
    Token Validation and Expiration:
        Validate the JWT's signature integrity to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.
        Verify the expiration time (exp) claim to enforce token expiration.
    Token Refresh and Renewal:
        Generate new JWTs with extended expiration times to allow token refreshment.
    Customization and Extensibility:
        Customize token signing and parsing behavior with options and callbacks.
        Extend the package's functionality by implementing custom signing methods or token handling logic.
    Well-documented API:
        The package provides comprehensive documentation and examples for each function and type.
