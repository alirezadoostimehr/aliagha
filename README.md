3. Version Control
⦁	Git Basics

⦁	Branching and Merging
Branching Strategy:Trunk-Based Development:
Trunk-Based Development is based on the following principles:

a. Mainline Branch: Our team maintains a single mainline branch ("main") as the central source of truth for the project.

b. Continuous Integration: Developers integrate their changes into the mainline branch multiple times throughout the day.

c. Short-Lived Feature Branches: Feature branches are created for developing new features or addressing specific issues. These branches have a short lifespan and are merged back into the mainline branch as soon as they are ready.

d. Minimal Long-Lived Branches: Long-lived branches are discouraged to prevent divergence and minimize integration difficulties.

Git Usage in Our Team:
Our team utilizes Git as the version control system to support Trunk-Based Development. Here's an overview of how we use Git:

a. Mainline Branch:
The master branch serves as our mainline branch.
It always represents the latest stable version of the codebase.

b. Feature Development:
For new feature development or bug fixes, developers create feature branches based on the master branch.
Feature branches have clear names and follow a consistent naming convention.
Developers work on their feature branches, making regular commits as they progress.

c. Continuous Integration:
Developers frequently integrate their changes into the mainline branch by merging or rebasing their feature branches onto the latest master.
Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines are set up to automatically build, test, and validate the code changes before merging them into the mainline branch.

d. Code Review:
Pull Requests (PRs) or Code Review processes are followed to ensure quality and maintain code standards.
Before merging a feature branch into the mainline, it must receive approval from at least one reviewer.

e. Merging to Mainline:
Once a feature branch is reviewed and approved, it is merged into the mainline branch.
Merge commits are used to preserve the history and provide traceability.

f. Release Process:
We follow a release branching strategy for preparing stable releases.
Release branches are created from the master branch, and specific release-related tasks are performed on these branches.
Once a release branch is ready, it is merged back into the master branch, and a new release is tagged.

g. Conflict Resolution:
In case of conflicts during merging, developers work collaboratively to resolve them.
Regular communication and collaboration are encouraged to minimize conflicts and keep the mainline branch stable.
Conclusion:
Trunk-Based Development, supported by Git, enables our team to achieve frequent integration, maintain a stable mainline branch, and deliver features more efficiently. By utilizing short-lived feature branches, continuous integration, and collaborative code review, we enhance code quality, reduce integration risks, and streamline our development process.
4. Packages:
github.com/spf13/cobra: 
The github.com/spf13/cobra package is a powerful library for building command-line applications in Go. It provides a simple and elegant way to define commands, flags, and arguments, making it easy to create robust CLI tools. This documentation will guide you through the initialization, usage, and notable features of the Cobra package in your project.

Initialization
To initialize the Cobra package, you need to import the necessary packages and create a root command using the cobra.Command struct. Here's an example of how to initialize Cobra:
import (
	"github.com/spf13/cobra"
)

var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "yourapp",
	Short: "A brief description of your application",
	Long:  "A longer description that spans multiple lines and likely contains examples and usage of using your application.",
}

In the above code, we create a root command with the cobra.Command struct. The Use field represents the command name, and the Short and Long fields provide brief and detailed descriptions of your application, respectively.

Usage
Cobra allows you to define subcommands, flags, and arguments for your application. Here's an example of how to define a subcommand and a required flag:
var serveConfigPath string

var serveCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "serve",
	Short: "Start the server",
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		startServer()
	},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(serveCmd)
	serveCmd.Flags().StringVarP(&serveConfigPath, "config", "c", "", "Path to the YAML configuration file (required)")
	serveCmd.MarkFlagRequired("config")
}
In the above code, we define a subcommand named "serve" using the cobra.Command struct. The Run field specifies the function to be executed when the command is invoked. We also define a required flag named "config" using the StringVarP method, which binds the flag value to the serveConfigPath variable. The MarkFlagRequired method ensures that the flag is mandatory.

You can define additional subcommands, flags, and arguments in a similar manner.

Features
The Cobra package offers several features that make building command-line applications more convenient. Here are some notable features:

Subcommands: Cobra allows you to define nested subcommands, providing a hierarchical structure to your CLI application.
Flags and Arguments: You can define flags and arguments for commands, allowing users to provide additional input to your application.
Command Help: Cobra automatically generates help information for commands, including usage, descriptions, flags, and arguments.
Command Aliases: You can define aliases for commands, allowing users to invoke commands using alternative names.
Persistent Flags and Commands: Cobra supports persistent flags and commands, which are inherited by all subcommands.
Command Execution Order: Cobra provides a flexible execution order for commands, allowing you to define pre-run and post-run functions.
Command Hooks: You can define hooks that are executed before or after a command or subcommand.
Command Validation: Cobra allows you to validate and sanitize user input, ensuring that the provided values meet the expected criteria.

"github.com/spf13/viper":
The Viper package is used in the project to handle configuration settings. It allows us to read configuration values from various sources such as files, environment variables, and command-line flags. This documentation provides an overview of how to initialize and use the Viper package in our project.

Initialization
To initialize the Viper package, we need to provide the configuration file path, name, and type. The Init function handles the initialization process. Here's an example of how to use it:
type Params struct {
	FilePath string
	FileName string
	FileType string
}

func Init(param Params) (*Config, error) {
	viper.SetConfigType(param.FileType)
	viper.AddConfigPath(param.FilePath)

	err := viper.ReadInConfig()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to read file: %s", err)
	}

	// Configuration structure initialization...

	return &Config{
		// Configuration field assignments...
	}, nil
}

In the Params struct, we provide the FilePath, FileName, and FileType values to specify the location and type of your configuration file. The Init function sets up the Viper package by specifying the configuration type, adding the configuration path, and reading the configuration file using viper.ReadInConfig().

Usage
Once the Viper package is initialized, we can access the configuration values using viper.GetString(key) or viper.GetInt(key) methods, where key is the configuration key we want to retrieve. Here's an example of accessing configuration values:
func Init(param Params) (*Config, error) {
	// Viper initialization code...

	redis := &Redis{
		Host:     viper.GetString("redis.host"),
		Port:     viper.GetInt("redis.port"),
		Password: viper.GetString("redis.password"),
	}

	// Other configuration value retrievals...

	return &Config{
		Redis: *redis,
		// Other configuration assignments...
	}, nil
}

In the example above, the redis.host, redis.port, and redis.password values are retrieved using viper.GetString() and viper.GetInt() methods and assigned to the Redis struct fields.

We can access other configuration values in a similar manner by specifying the respective keys.

Features
The Viper package provides several features to enhance the configuration handling in our project. Here are some notable features:

Configuration Sources: Viper supports reading configuration values from various sources, including files (JSON, YAML, TOML, etc.), environment variables, and command-line flags.
Automatic Environment Variable Binding: Viper can automatically bind configuration values to environment variables. By following a specific naming convention, we can override configuration values using environment variables.
Default Values: Viper allows you to set default values for configuration keys. If a configuration value is not found, Viper will fall back to the default value.
Watch and Hot-Reload: Viper provides the ability to watch configuration files for changes and automatically reload the configuration when modifications occur. This is useful for dynamically updating configuration settings during runtime.
Nested Configurations: Viper supports nested configurations, allowing you to organize our configuration values into hierarchical structures.

golang-migrate/migrate/v4:
The github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4 package is a database migration tool written in Go. It provides a way to manage and apply database schema changes using migration files. This documentation will guide you through the initialization, usage, and notable features of the golang-migrate/migrate/v4 package in our project.
To install the golang-migrate/migrate/v4 package in your Go project, you can use the go get command. Here's how you can install it:
Open your terminal or command prompt.

Run the following command to install the golang-migrate/migrate/v4 package:
go get -u github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4
This command fetches the package and its dependencies from the GitHub repository and installs them in your project's vendor directory.
Initialization
To initialize the golang-migrate/migrate/v4 package, you need to import the necessary packages and create a migration instance using the migrate.NewWithDatabaseInstance function. Here's an example of how to initialize the package with a MySQL database:
import (
	"github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4"
	_ "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/source/file"
)
Usage
The golang-migrate/migrate/v4 package provides methods for performing database migrations, including applying and rolling back migrations. Here's an example of how to use the package:
m, err := migrate.New("file:///path/to/migrations", "database://user:password@tcp(host:port)/dbname")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

err = m.Up()
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
In the above code, we create a new migration instance (m) by providing the migration file path and the database connection string. Then, we use the Up method to apply the migrations. If an error occurs during the migration process, it is handled by the panic statement.

Similarly, you can use the Down method to roll back migrations:
err = m.Down()
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
The Down method rolls back the most recently applied migration.

Features
The golang-migrate/migrate/v4 package offers several features to simplify database migration management. Here are some notable features:

Migration Files: The package supports migration files that define the necessary SQL statements or Go code to modify the database schema. You can create migration files manually or use tools to generate them automatically.
Migration Operations: The package provides methods to apply migrations (Up), roll back migrations (Down), and check the current migration status (Version). You can use these methods to manage the database schema changes easily.
Multiple Database Drivers: The package supports multiple database drivers, allowing you to migrate different types of databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more.
Version Control: The package tracks the applied migrations using a version table in the database. It ensures that each migration is applied only once and allows you to easily manage the migration history.
Programmatic API: The package provides a programmatic API that allows you to integrate migration functionality into your Go applications and workflows. You can use the API to perform migrations during application startup or as part of an automated deployment process.

go get github.com/labstack/echo/v4
This command fetches the package and its dependencies from the GitHub repository and installs them in your project's vendor directory.
To initialize the Echo v4 package, you need to import the necessary packages and create an instance of the echo.Echo struct. Here's an example of how to initialize Echo:
import (
	"github.com/labstack/echo/v4"
	"net/http"
)
	e := echo.New()

In the above code, we import the necessary package and create a new instance of echo.Echo using the echo.New() function.

Usage
The Echo v4 package provides a wide range of features for building web applications. Here are some common tasks and usage examples:

Handling Routes
Echo v4 allows you to define routes and handle HTTP requests using various HTTP methods. Here's an example of handling a GET request on the /users route:
e.GET("/users", func(c echo.Context) error {
	// Handle the request
	return c.String(http.StatusOK, "Hello, users!")
})
In the above code, we define a GET route using e.GET(). The second argument is the handler function, which takes an echo.Context parameter representing the request and response context. Inside the handler function, you can process the request and return a response.

Middleware
Echo v4 supports middleware, which allows you to perform additional processing on requests and responses. Middleware functions can be used for tasks such as authentication, logging, error handling, and more. Here's an example of adding a logger middleware:
e.Use(middleware.Logger())

In the above code, we use the Use() method to add the logger middleware to the Echo instance. Middleware functions can be chained together using multiple Use() calls.

Request and Response Handling
Echo v4 provides a rich set of features for handling request data and constructing responses. You can access query parameters, form data, and request headers, as well as set response headers and body content. Here's an example of accessing query parameters and returning a JSON response:

e.GET("/user", func(c echo.Context) error {
	name := c.QueryParam("name")
	age := c.QueryParam("age")

	// Process the parameters and construct a response
	user := User{Name: name, Age: age}
	return c.JSON(http.StatusOK, user)
})
In the above code, we access query parameters using c.QueryParam(). We process the parameters, create a User object, and return a JSON response using c.JSON().

Error Handling: Echo provides features for handling errors, including custom error handling middleware and centralized error handling.
Static File Serving: Echo can serve static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images from a specified directory.
github.com/go-playground/validator/v10:

The github.com/go-playground/validator/v10 package is a powerful and flexible data validation library for Go. It provides a simple and declarative way to validate structs, fields, and individual values. This documentation will guide you through the initialization, usage, and notable features of the Validator v10 package in your project, taking into account its dependencies.

Initialization
To install the validator v10 package in your project, you can use the go get command. Here's how you can install it:
Open your terminal or command prompt.

Run the following command to install the validator v10 package:
go get github.com/go-playground/validator/v10
This command fetches the package and its dependencies from the GitHub repository and installs them in your project's vendor directory.
To initialize the Validator v10 package, you need to import the necessary package and create an instance of the validator.Validate struct. Here's an example of how to initialize Validator v10:
import (
	"github.com/go-playground/validator/v10"
)

v := validator.New()

In the above code, we import the necessary package and create a new instance of validator.Validate using the validator.New() function.

Usage
The Validator v10 package provides various validation tags and functions to validate structs, fields, and individual values. Here are some common tasks and usage examples:

Struct Validation
Struct validation allows you to validate the fields of a struct based on predefined rules. Here's an example of validating a User struct:

type User struct {
	Name  string `validate:"required"`
	Email string `validate:"required,email"`
	Age   int    `validate:"gte=0,lte=150"`
}

func validateUser(user User) error {
	err := v.Struct(user)
	if err != nil {
		// Handle validation errors
		return err
	}

	// Validation successful
	return nil
}
In the above code, we define a User struct with validation tags. We use the v.Struct() function to validate the struct, and if there are any validation errors, we handle them accordingly.

Field Validation
Field validation allows you to validate individual fields based on specific rules. Here's an example of validating a field using a custom validation function:
type User struct {
	Password string `validate:"required,strongPassword"`
}

func strongPassword(fl validator.FieldLevel) bool {
	password := fl.Field().String()

	// Perform custom validation logic
	// Return true if valid, false otherwise
}

func validateUser(user User) error {
	v.RegisterValidation("strongPassword", strongPassword)

	err := v.Struct(user)
	if err != nil {
		// Handle validation errors
		return err
	}

	// Validation successful
	return nil
}
In the above code, we define a custom validation function strongPassword and register it with the validator using v.RegisterValidation(). We use the validate:"strongPassword" tag on the Password field to apply the custom validation.

Value Validation
Value validation allows you to validate individual values outside the context of a struct. Here's an example of validating an email address:

func validateEmail(email string) error {
	err := v.Var(email, "required,email")
	if err != nil {
		// Handle validation errors
		return err
	}

	// Validation successful
	return nil
}

In the above code, we use the v.Var() function to validate the email value based on the specified validation tags.

Features
Validator v10 offers a wide range of features and capabilities for data validation. Here are some notable features:

Struct Validation: Validator v10 allows you to define validation rules for entire structs, validating multiple fields at once.
Field Validation: You can apply validation rules to individual fields using tags or custom validation functions.
Tag-based Validation: Validator v10 provides a comprehensive set of built-in validation tags for common validation scenarios.

5. Database:
Database Design:

The database design process involves analyzing requirements, creating a conceptual design, applying normalization techniques, and defining the logical and physical structures of the database.
The resulting design serves as a blueprint for implementing the data models.
Data Model Development:

We utilize the GORM ORM framework to build data models that map to the database tables.
The following steps describe our approach:
a. Database Connection Initialization:

The InitDB function initializes the database connection using the provided database configuration.
The GORM library is used to establish the connection to the MySQL database.
The function returns a GORM DB instance or an error if the connection fails.
b. Configuration Management:

The Init function in the config package initializes the application configuration using the Viper library.
The configuration is read from a file specified by the Params argument.
The file format and path are set based on the provided parameters.
Configuration settings are retrieved using the Viper library's GetString, GetInt, and similar functions.
c. Data Model Definition:

Data models are defined as Go structs using the GORM syntax or annotations.
The models represent the entities and attributes defined in the database design.
Relationships between models can be defined using associations, such as "belongs to," "has one," and "has many."
Models include field tags that specify database column names, data types, and constraints.
d. Validation and Business Logic:

Data validation rules can be added to the data models using the GORM library or custom validation functions.
Validation rules ensure data integrity and enforce constraints on the input data.
Custom business logic can be implemented within the model methods to encapsulate complex data operations.
e. Custom Query Execution:

To execute custom queries, we utilize the GORM ORM's raw SQL capabilities.
Raw SQL queries can be executed using the Exec or Raw methods of the GORM DB instance.
The SQL queries can include placeholders for dynamic values, which can be provided as arguments to the query execution functions.
Results of the query execution can be mapped to custom structs or retrieved using the GORM ORM's Scan or Find methods.
f. Migration:

Database schema changes are managed using migration scripts.
Migration tools like golang-migrate can be used to version and apply database schema modifications.
Migration scripts allow for seamless updates to the database schema without data loss.
