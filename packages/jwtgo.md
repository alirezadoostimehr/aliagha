## Usage
The `github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go` package provides functionality for working with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. Here's how you can use the package in your application:

Import the package in your Go file:
import `"github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go"`
Use the package's functions, types, and constants to work with JWTs.

## Features
* The github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go package offers the following features:

	* JWT Creation and Signing:

Generate new JWTs with custom claims using the jwt.NewWithClaims function.
Sign JWTs with a secret key using the jwt.SigningMethodHMAC or jwt.SigningMethodRSA methods.
	* JWT Parsing and Verification:

Parse and validate JWTs using the jwt.Parse or jwt.ParseWithClaims functions.
Verify the JWT's signature, expiration, and other claims.
	* Custom Claims and Metadata:

Create custom claim types by implementing the jwt.Claims interface.
Add custom claims to a JWT during creation.
	* Supported Signing Algorithms:
HMAC algorithms: HMAC-SHA, HMAC-SHA256, HMAC-SHA384, HMAC-SHA512.
RSA algorithms: RS256, RS384, RS512.
ECDSA algorithms: ES256, ES384, ES512.
	* Token Validation and Expiration:

Validate the JWT's signature integrity to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.
Verify the expiration time (exp) claim to enforce token expiration.
	* Token Refresh and Renewal:

Generate new JWTs with extended expiration times to allow token refreshment.
	* Customization and Extensibility:

Customize token signing and parsing behavior with options and callbacks.
Extend the package's functionality by implementing custom signing methods or token handling logic.
	* Well-documented API:

The package provides comprehensive documentation and examples for each function and type.
