# Cobra-Cli

This package is a powerful library for building command-line applications in Go. It provides a simple and elegant way to define commands, flags, and arguments, making it easy to create robust CLI tools. This documentation will guide you through the initialization, usage, and notable features of the Cobra package in your project.

## Initialization
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project's directory.
3. Run the following command to install SPF13 Cobra-CLI: ` go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra/cobra `.

4. Wait for the installation process to complete. It will download and install the necessary files.
5. import the necessary packages and create a root command using the cobra.Command struct. Here's an example of how to initialize Cobra:
```import (
	"github.com/spf13/cobra"
)
```
```var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "yourapp",
	Short: "A brief description of your application",
	Long:  "A longer description that spans multiple lines and likely contains examples and usage of using your application.",
}
```
In the above code, we create a root command with the cobra.Command struct. The Use field represents the command name, and the Short and Long fields provide brief and detailed descriptions of your application, respectively.

## Usage

Cobra allows you to define subcommands, flags, and arguments for your application. Here's an example of how to define a subcommand and a required flag:
var serveConfigPath string

```var serveCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "serve",
	Short: "Start the server",
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		startServer()
	},
}
```
```func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(serveCmd)
	serveCmd.Flags().StringVarP(&serveConfigPath, "config", "c", "", "Path to the YAML configuration file (required)")
	serveCmd.MarkFlagRequired("config")
}
```
In the above code, we define a subcommand named "serve" using the cobra.Command struct. The Run field specifies the function to be executed when the command is invoked. We also define a required flag named "config" using the StringVarP method, which binds the flag value to the serveConfigPath variable. The MarkFlagRequired method ensures that the flag is mandatory.

You can define additional subcommands, flags, and arguments in a similar manner.


## Features
#### The Cobra package offers several features that make building command-line applications more convenient. Here are some notable features:

* Subcommands: Cobra allows you to define nested subcommands, providing a hierarchical structure to your CLI application.
* Flags and Arguments: You can define flags and arguments for commands, allowing users to provide additional input to your application.
* Command Help: Cobra automatically generates help information for commands, including usage, descriptions, flags, and arguments.
* Command Aliases: You can define aliases for commands, allowing users to invoke commands using alternative names.
* Persistent Flags and Commands: Cobra supports persistent flags and commands, which are inherited by all subcommands.
* Command Execution Order: Cobra provides a flexible execution order for commands, allowing you to define pre-run and post-run functions.
* Command Hooks: You can define hooks that are executed before or after a command or subcommand.
* Command Validation: Cobra allows you to validate and sanitize user input, ensuring that the provided values meet the expected criteria.
